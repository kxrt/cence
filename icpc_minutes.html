            August 21 and 26, 2023
          </h4>
          <p>
            Thank you to the ICPC community for coming from around the world to
            tour Huawei and participate in the ICPC Challenge Championship
            powered by Huawei. We will continue to support your global events,
            and also all kinds of contests for university students in subjects
            like math, physics, and biology.
          </p>
          <img src="images/minutes1.jpg" width="850px" />
          <p style="font-weight: 600">
            I. We are set to embark on the journey of the Fourth Industrial
            Revolution, during which a huge abundance of computing power will
            serve as the foundation. Young people today may become the leaders
            of the Fourth Industrial Revolution tomorrow. The reason we support
            contests is to build a stage for young people to shine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teamwork is not only the basis for winning contests, but also the
            basis for survival. More importantly, teamwork is necessary to drive
            greater prosperity for humanity. It is essential that we work
            closely together. When we come together, we will inspire and compete
            with each other. This will lead to the explosive development of new
            scientific technologies. Elites from 25 countries are happily
            gathered here today. After getting to know each other, we will
            exchange ideas on a common platform. Coaches, students, teams can
            inspire each other. This may leave behind great memories and ignite
            sparks. When these young people return home, they can light big
            fires of innovation to their own communities. New scientific
            technologies are sure to help create more wealth, eliminate poverty,
            and improve people's lives, enabling humanity to embark on a road
            towards affluence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Fourth Industrial Revolution is massive and its scale is far
            beyond our imagination. Young people today will become the leaders
            of the era of massive computing power. All of society places great
            hope upon you. You will surely shine like stars during the AI
            revolution over the next two to three decades.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: 600">
            II. Huawei has always followed the principle of identifying and
            developing talent, but never seeking monopoly in this regard. We
            will continue opening our arms to embrace global talent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Global development is inseparable from technological progress and
            talent exchange. Faster development and better talent will be the
            basis for countries to prosper. Huawei is willing to work with
            academia to cultivate outstanding talent in the information domain.
            However, we will never seek monopoly in this regard. After studying
            and growing at Huawei, such talent will return to their own
            countries. This will be conducive to the rejuvenation of the
            information sectors of these countries.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: 600">
            III. We will support contests over the long term, and will sponsor
            the organizers of both global and regional contests. And we will not
            only continue supporting contests but also increase our sponsorship
            for such events.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will support the ICPC Foundation hosting world finals in Asia
            East, and will more regularly invite outstanding contestants and
            coaches to visit China, for example, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou,
            Shanghai, Guizhou, and border provinces like Xinjiang and Tibet.
            China has many very beautiful counties that are worth visiting. In
            these places, the contestants and coaches can see China's industry
            development and urban construction firsthand. They can take
            high-speed trains to experience the speed of development in China.
            They can also have coffee, try barbecue or Chinese cuisine, and
            experience the country's cultural climate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from supporting or co-organizing global software contests, we
            are supporting contests in other subjects, like informatics, math,
            physics, chemistry, biology, and neural networks. We will also
            support young people majoring in such subjects, inspire them to
            become interests in scientific research, and thus help cultivate
            talent in basic science.
          </p>
          <p style="font-weight: 600">
            IV. We will open up our campuses worldwide and support ICPC contests
            on our campuses. We will also provide access to our facilities where
            students can experience what it is like to work at Huawei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Huawei provides the world's bright young minds with both IT
            technical challenges and internship and research opportunities. We
            offer these individuals access to Huawei's device-edge-network-cloud
            platform, and the chance to explore the fundamentals and frontiers
            that are key to addressing top challenges. By organizing contests
            and inspiring open discussions on our Chaspark website, we create
            multiple channels through which young people can understand
            real-world challenges in industry. If they win prize money from our
            contests, they can spend more time studying, rather than working
            part-time to earn their tuition fees. This is a good way for young
            people to grow faster.

              First, I would like to thank Huawei for its generous support in
              helping train our students and organize contests. I'd like to
              discuss two contest organizations. The first is the IOI, which is
              a pipeline to the ICPC. The IOI mainly focuses on discovering and
              training talent. But the IOI is currently facing some problems.
              There are over 90 countries involved in the IOI, but many aren't,
              such as Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, and Myanmar. Therefore, all these
              countries need our support. I think this aligns with Huawei's
              vision - spreading information technologies to every corner of the
              world. Even those who are currently part of the IOI are facing
              problems. They don't have the resources necessary to train
              students. So even though they take part in the IOI, there is very
              little possibility of them winning a medal. Therefore, they won't
              be able to participate in the ICPC. So I really hope that Huawei
              can actually give us some support. Second, I want to talk about
              the EGOI, which stands for the European Girls' Olympiad in
              Informatics. I think this is a great trend. Among our 58
              participants, there is only one girl, which is less than 2%. I
              hope that Huawei can help address gender imbalance within such
              contests.</i

            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> When Singapore was founded, Lee Kuan Yew enacted two
            important national policies. The first was to choose English as one
            of Singapore's national languages, which has helped connect the
            country to a wider world. The second was to make Chinese, or
            Mandarin, another official language. These policies help the country
            connect to two major parts of the wider world. Today, our computer
            contest aims to unify both the language of computers and the
            standards in the era of massive computing power. We aim to remove
            the obstacles and misunderstandings between us through exchanges
            over cups of coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, we've connected the 25 participating countries. A spark
            can shine brightly, and even lead to big fires of innovation for a
            country. The coaches and young people here are welcome to China at
            any time. You already have the contact information of many of our
            colleagues, so you can stay in touch with them. The young people
            present here are our long-term partners. In addition to the ICPC, we
            will support the IOI and contests in subjects like math, physics,
            chemistry, biology, and neural networks. Together, we can help
            cultivate talent in basic science.

            <b>ICPC team coach from Northern Eurasia:</b>
            <i
              >I have been working as an ICPC champion team coach for ten years.
              Many companies are supportive of talent development efforts, but
              they rarely seem willing to support large contests like the ICPC,
              as such contests may not be directly related to their own
              business. Things changed a lot when Huawei opened local resource
              centers and started supporting contests. In my opinion, Huawei's
              goal is to recruit talent and, more importantly, help local
              communities cultivate their own talent. We have received
              considerable support from the contest management department, and
              25 students from my champion teams have joined Huawei. Why are
              contests so important to Huawei's business development? Why does
              Huawei believe that contests are essential?</i

          <p>
            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> Huawei is a business organization, but we do not
            seek only profits. We are committed to sponsoring contests, and we
            do not do this to acquire talent. Going forward, we will ramp up our
            support for contests. A moment ago, when I was having coffee with
            ICPC leadership, and expressed my hope that more contests could be
            organized, including those related to subjects like informatics,
            math, physics, chemistry, biology, and neural networks. We will
            support these contests no matter whether or not they are related to
            Huawei's business. We have also discussed and agreed that scientific
            technologies should be used to help create more wealth and eliminate
            poverty, enabling humanity to embark on a road towards affluence.

            <i
              >I'm very proud because a contestant from Latin America won the
              championship. Like him, there are many other outstanding students
              from our region. But I found that it is rare to see employees from
              Latin America at Huawei. My question is: Does Huawei welcome Latin
              American talent to come for internships? For example, does China
              offer any systematic support?</i
            >

          <p>
            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> At Huawei, we welcome outstanding talent from all
            countries, including those in Latin America. We have an online
            platform called "Chaspark", where students can contact and
            communicate with our experts. They may be offered internships at
            Huawei if the experts think face-to-face communication is necessary.
            Let's take a simple example. Who invented 5G, which the US has
            devoted so much time and effort to restrict? Who invented Polar
            Code? Professor Erdal Arikan, from Türkiye. He published a
            mathematical paper more than a decade ago. We discovered this paper
            two weeks after its release. Then we arranged for thousands of
            scientists and experts to study and analyze this paper, and conduct
            related engineering work. That's how we developed world-leading 5G.
            There are always talented people we can work with. Of course, most
            of them are likely to be found in the US. Nobody can know where
            geniuses will emerge. You are welcome to communicate with our
            experts on our online platform Chaspark.

            down on our efforts in this area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Higher education should be well-tailored. We should not always
            stress the use of unified teaching materials. I don't agree with the
            slogan "do not let children lose at the starting line" used for
            elementary and secondary education. We should not make excellent
            students wait for those who are left behind. Education in China must
            be revitalized.

            <b>A contestant from Europe:</b>
            <i
              >There is a kind of scientific research called useless research.
              It is deemed useless in the short term because we do not know
              where it can be applied, though it is very important in the long
              term. This kind of research may be primarily conducted by
              universities rather than companies. What is Huawei's view on this
              so-called useless research? Will you fund this type of
              research?</i

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> What is science? Science is all about the unknown.
            In his book Science, The Endless Frontier, American scientist
            Vannevar Bush suggested that the US should study things that are
            seemingly useless and remote, that is, the so-called "useless"
            science. In the 1990s, Princeton University Professor Donald Stokes
            wrote a book Pasteur's Quadrant: Basic Science and Technological
            Innovation, which talks about how to use applications to guide
            scientific research and bring the so-called "useless" science
            together and translate it into useful applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, the boundaries between science and technology are
            blurring, and the time it takes for science to translate into
            technology is being reduced. If we only begin to develop technology
            after universities have finished research on relevant theories, we
            will lose our first-mover advantage and competitive edge. That's why
            we value basic theoretical research. Every year, we invest about 3
            to 5 billion US dollars in this area. We work hand in hand with
            universities to explore seemingly useless science.

            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> These contests are purely academic activities and

            human resource department in your country. Outstanding talent from
            around the world are welcome to join us. Bangladesh's population is
            set to reach 200 million in the near future, and the West sees the
            country as one of the next emerging industrial nations. With
            outstanding talent like you, I believe Bangladesh will embark on a
            journey of accelerated development. But what is the foundation for
            this kind of development? Speed. I hope you are among the first to
            take what you have learned back to Bangladesh and help your country

              R&D centers in Mexico. Does Huawei have any plans to set up an R&D
              facility in Mexico or Latin America in the future?</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> I think the President of our 2012 Laboratories has
            more information on the distribution of our R&D facilities outside
            China. We'll forward your question to him. Mexico has a magnificent
            history. Today, we still have a lot to learn about the ancient Maya
            civilization. Civilization in Mexico dates back millennia, and its
            influence can be found in many countries around the world. I think
            we may consider establishing an R&D facility in Mexico, but that
            also depends on the specific plans of our 2012 Laboratories. In the
            past, we built our R&D centers around the world, with the US at the
            center. After the US began imposing restrictions on Huawei, we
            gradually shifted our focus to Europe and Asia, and reduced our
            presence in Latin America. The US has a lot of influence in Latin
            America, so we need to further assess the situation in the region.

          <p>
            <b>Mr. Ren:</b> I paid a visit to the US right after Huawei was
            founded, in order to learn the US's corporate management systems.
            The main model we looked at was that of IBM. First, we learned IBM's
            goal management. The company placed customers at the center of
            everything it did. With this approach, it set a common goal of
            serving customers, which united its employees. Second, we learned
            the Integrated Product Development Process, or IPD, from IBM. This
            process is about getting market and service representatives involved
            in R&D. With IPD, we have a forward-looking organization that
            advances our R&D efforts. After that, we learned the Integrated
            Financial Services (IFS) and Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) processes
            from IBM. In this way, we built a clear process system. Another
            important issue is value distribution. For this issue, we tried to
            find where Huawei's wealth lies and how we should distribute it. We
            believe that our company's wealth lies in the brains of our
            employees, and we thus distribute value to employees based on the
            "weight" of the knowledge held in their brains. In our distribution
            system, the ratio of return on labor to return on capital is 3 to 1.

            makes Apple products so good and try to understand the gaps between
            us and Apple. It's a good thing that we have someone to look up to.
